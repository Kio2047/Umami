## **Another social media app?**

Touch√©... but the goal of Umami isn't to introduce yet another hub for doomscrolling. The ingenuity of social discovery apps lies in their ability to convert screen time into enriching real-life experiences. We're more invested in the opinions and experiences of people we know than those of anonymous internet strangers ‚Äî which is why we have LetterBoxd for movies, Goodreads for books, Backloggd for video games... but nothing for restaurants, yet. For foodies, that's a gap worth filling.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**

- TypeScript
- Expo + React Native

**Backend**

- TypeScript
- Node.js + Express (REST API)
- Zod (validation)
- JWT (auth)

**Database**

- MongoDB
- Mongoose (ODM)

**Media & Hosting**

- Cloudinary (media hosting)

**Tooling**

- Docker (database container + seeding)
- PNPM (monorepo/workspaces)

## **Getting Started**

To try Umami for yourself, you'll need:

- Node.js ‚â• 18.17.0 with Corepack enabled
- Docker
- A Cloudinary product environment you can write to and read from
- Expo Go mobile app

### **Setting up the application**

From the root folder:

1. Install all dependencies across the root, `client` and `api` workspaces:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start Docker, then initialise and seed the database with mock data:

   ```bash
   pnpm run init-db
   ```

3. Create a .env file in the `api` workspace and add the following environment variables:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
   DB_NAME=dev
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-api-secret>
   ```
   `JWT_SECRET` can be any string that satisfies the schema defined in [`envSchema`](api/src/validations.ts). Cloudinary credentials must be obtained from your Cloudinary dashboard.
4. Start the API server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run start-api
   ```

5. Create a .env file in the `client` workspace and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="<machine-ip-address>:<server-port>"
   EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>
   EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>
   ```

   Use the private IP address of the machine running the API to allow other devices (like your phone running Expo Go) to connect to the server without needing a tunnel. You can find your private IP address by running:

   - macOS / Linux: ifconfig or ip a
   - Windows: ipconfig

6. Start the Expo client:

   ```bash
   pnpm run start-client
   ```

   If the Expo Go app runs into issues loading the project, make sure your firewall allows inbound connections to Node.js apps. If that doesn't resolve things, try running the client using a tunnel to bypass firewall restrictions:

   ```bash
   pnpm run start-client-tunnel
   ```

7. You're good to go!

### **Note: Usage of PNPM with Expo**

Unfortunately, Expo / React native currently don't play well with pnpm's use of symlinks and isolated `node_modules` ‚Äî see [this Expo issue](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/22413) and [this pnpm discussion](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/4286#issuecomment-2483856710). To work around this, dependencies currently need to be hoisted (via `node-linker=hoisted` in `.npmrc`) or [tinker manually with the Metro bundler's config](https://gist.github.com/Zn4rK/ed60c380e7b672e3089074f51792a2b8). Hoisting of course undermines the main point of using pnpm in the first place ‚Äî fortunately though, Expo is working on addressing this problem so projects can use pnpm with its efficiency and speed benefits intact. See [here](https://github.com/byCedric/expo-monorepo-example?tab=readme-ov-file#pnpm-workarounds) for more information.
