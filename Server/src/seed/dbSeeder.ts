For mains we had the crab curry, tamarind chicken and the lamb cutlets, the curry was probably the best but all of these were totally sublime. To finish we had the plantain tarte tatin, chocolate torte and carrot cake with pineapple, all nice but not at the level of the starters. We washed them all down with a selection of â€˜tropicalâ€™ cocktails as itâ€™s 24/7 happy hour for July / August. It's far from cheap though - I'll probably be living off of baked beans and toast for the foreseeable future. Worth it? Not sure, but the food was wicked",
